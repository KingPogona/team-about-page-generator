## Usage 

To use this app will require having Node.js installed on your machine. After installing the app, navigate to the root folder 'team-about-page-generator' in your terminal. Next, type 'node index" followed by hitting enter. This will run the program and provide a list of prompts. After answering every prompt the program will generate the completed HTML file in the dist folder within 'team-about-page-generator'. Now you can further edit this file as you see fit and use this team page however you like. If you want to use the generator again, simply make sure you have navigated to the 'team-about-page-generator' root folder in your terminal and run 'node index' once more. Please note that this will over-write the previously generated file in the dist folder.
